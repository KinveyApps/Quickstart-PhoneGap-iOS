# TestDrive-PhoneGap-iOS

> The TestDrive sample application provides you with a near blank template to get started with. It is great for learning and trying Kinvey, or to build your first application upon.

*It is recommended to update to [v1 of the library](http://devcenter.kinvey.com/phonegap/). The TestDrive for that version is available [here](https://github.com/KinveyApps/TestDrive-PhoneGap).*

## Run It
After downloading or cloning the repository:

* Replace `<your-app-key>` and `<your-app-secret>` (lines 14–15 in `PhoneGapTutorial/www/index.html`).
* Deploy the project to the iOS Simulator.

## Functionality
This application demonstrates:

* Basic set-up for PhoneGap apps using Kinvey
* Pinging the service

## Architecture
The starting point of this application is `PhoneGapTutorial/www/index.html`. Here, you can put your application. Code to connect your app with Kinvey is already inserted.

By default, the sample app performs a ping against the Kinvey service. If you want to get rid of this functionality, simply remove lines 19–26.

To learn more about the features PhoneGap provides, read the [PhoneGap Documentation](http://docs.phonegap.com).

#### PhoneGap
Currently, the sample application uses PhoneGap 1.7. This version will be updated in the near future.
